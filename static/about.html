            <p>When considering the factors for each state as well as available homes, there will be a huge amount of data. These data pulls will come from various sources, making storage and data gathering very important. Our research provided many conceptual ideas of how to gather, access, and format the data. (11)
                Large values could influence the output of our equation therefore each dataset was standardized for equal weighing and comparison. This standard score was reported on each index. Factors with higher magnitudes can influence the output of our equation, so we used a standard deviation (or Z-Score) calculation to determine each data point's differentiation from the data set's mean and then used the Z-Score to create a standardized index score. (13) This approach matches closely to rankings methodology for other real estate analysis.
                We consider index scores lower than 20 as very low, index scores between 20 and 40 as being low, index scores between 40 and 60 as being moderate, index scores between 60 and 80 as being high and finally index scores higher than 80 as being very high.</p>

            <p class="h6">The Job Market Index</P>
            Job market index measures the strength of each county's job market. We assessed two elements to determine how likely residents are to find employment in each county and their earning potential there. Each element was weighted equally to determine the job market index. The data (unemployment rate average annual employee, and average annual salary) was retrieved from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics by county.
            Unemployment rate: We calculated the rolling average unemployment rate. This represents whether the job market is growing, struggling, or remaining stable.
            Average salary: The average annual salary represents the earning potential of a county. It is also available for specific industries, but we have chosen to use an aggregate all industries.
            Annual average employed: The annual average employed represents the depth of the work force in a county.
            <p class="h6"> Health Index</P>
            The health index measures the potential for residents of a county to achieve optimal health. We assessed three elements for this index: access to exercise, food environment Index, and primary care ratio. Each element was weighted equally to determine the health index. The data was retrieved from a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.
            Access to exercise: Measures the population access to places for physical activity.
            Food environment Index: Indicator of access to healthy foods.
            Primary care ratio: Represents the population to primary care physicians.
            <p class="h6">Entertainment Index</P>
            The entertainment index measures how much enjoyment can be obtained from living in a county. We considered multiple elements to access enjoyment such as the number of business establishments, county to county migration flow, and transportation by transit. Each element was weighted equally to determine the entertainment index. The data was retrieved from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
            Business establishments: Business establishments are lumped into one bucket; in that we do not know the type of industry these businesses fall into. However, we can safely say the more businesses in a location the increased likelihood of shopping venues, restaurants, and other nightlife entertainment.
            Transportation by transit: The transportation by transit data represents personal mobility to everyone, allowing individuals to go virtually everywhere. This element measures accessibility to surrounding places. It removes the limitations of getting to local entertainment.
            County to county migration flow: This data set is important element, because it simply assumes people move to a location because of the factors we are interested in. We will use this data set to understand where people move.
            <p class="h6"> Cost of living Index</P>
            We have chosen to use the AdvisorSmith cost of living index. The AdvisorSmith cost of living index is modeled upon national average household budgets, with weights assigned to six major categories of household expenses. The expense categories along with their weights are food (16.1%), housing (23.2%), utilities (10.1%), transportation (18.6%), healthcare (9.6%), and consumer discretionary spending (22.3%).
            <p class="h6"> Crime Index</P>
            The crime index measures how safe a county maybe. We assessed two elements for this index: violent crime rate and Injury Death Rate. Each element was weighted equally to determine the crime index. The data was retrieved from a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.
            <p class="h6">Education Index</P>
            Education index is calculated based on US Census Bureau data of educational attainment for adults ages 25 and older and poverty rate. While these measures do not ensure success, they provide advantages. (12) Each measure is weighted equally to determine the education index
